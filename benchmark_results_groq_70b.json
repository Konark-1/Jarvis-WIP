      "Diagnosis: The likely cause of the task failure is an external API issue, specifically a connection timeout error. This could be due to a temporary network issue, a problem with the API server, or a firewall/blocking issue preventing the connection.\n\nSuggestion: Retry the task with a longer timeout period (e.g., 60 seconds) or use a different API endpoint if available. If the issue persists, consider using a fallback skill, such as searching a local cache or database for Groq API documentation, or reporting the issue to the API maintainers to investigate potential server-side problems. Additionally, verifying the network connection and checking for any firewall rules that might be blocking the request could also help resolve the issue.",
      "Diagnosis: The task failed due to a FileNotFoundError, indicating that the specified file '/data/project_alpha.log' does not exist in the expected location. This suggests that the file path provided as a parameter to the task is incorrect or the file has not been created yet.\n\nSuggestion: Verify the file path and name for accuracy, and ensure the file exists in the specified location before retrying the task. If the file is expected to be generated by a previous task, check the previous task's execution status and logs to confirm the file was created successfully. If the file is supposed to be uploaded or provided by an external source, check the upload or provision process to ensure the file is available in the expected location. Consider adding error handling or file existence checks to the task to provide more informative error messages or to retry the task if the file becomes available.",
      "Diagnosis: The error message \"SMTPServerDisconnected: Connection unexpectedly closed\" suggests that the connection to the SMTP server was lost during the email sending process, which is likely due to an external API issue, such as a temporary server outage, network connectivity problems, or the SMTP server terminating the connection.\n\nSuggestion: Retry the task with a short delay and a limited number of attempts (e.g., 3-5 attempts with 1-2 minute delays) to account for temporary server outages or network issues. If the issue persists, consider modifying the plan to use a different SMTP server or a fallback email service, and report the issue to the email service provider for further investigation. Additionally, verify that the email parameters, such as the recipient address and email content, are correct and compliant with the SMTP server's requirements.",
      "Diagnosis: The error message \"SkillError: Failed to download or parse PDF content\" suggests that the issue lies in either accessing the PDF file at the provided URL or in processing its content. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as the URL being incorrect, the PDF being corrupted, the server hosting the PDF being down, or the skill used for parsing the PDF encountering an unexpected format.\n\nSuggestion: Retry the task with an alternative approach, such as checking the URL for correctness and ensuring the PDF is accessible. If the issue persists, consider using a different skill or library for parsing the PDF, or attempt to download the PDF manually to verify its integrity. Additionally, if the PDF is very large or complex, it might be necessary to use a more specialized PDF parsing tool or service. If none of these strategies work, report the bug to the skill developer for further investigation.",
      "Diagnosis: The error message indicates that the response generation failed due to a content filter violation, which suggests that the generated graph contained content that was flagged as inappropriate or sensitive. This could be due to the user data containing sensitive information or the graph generation process inadvertently creating content that triggered the filter.\n\nSuggestion: Retry the task with modified parameters to sanitize the user data, such as anonymizing sensitive information or using data masking techniques. Alternatively, consider using a different graph generation algorithm or model that is less prone to generating sensitive content. If the issue persists, it may be necessary to modify the content filter rules or use a fallback skill that can generate graphs in a more controlled and safe manner. Additionally, it's essential to review the user data and graph generation process to identify the root cause of the content filter violation and prevent similar errors in the future."
